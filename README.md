# Plain-CNN-vs-ResNet-on-CIFAR-10-Overcoming-Vanishing-Gradients-with-Skip-Connections
This project compares ResNet50 trained from scratch vs pretrained ImageNet weights on CIFAR-10 using PyTorch. Includes training logs, accuracy tracking, evaluation, and insights showing how pretrained networks converge faster and achieve higher performance with fewer epochs.
